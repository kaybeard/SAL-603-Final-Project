# Final-Project
This repository will store code and data files for the SAL 603 final project.

For my final project I looked at how exit velocity and launch angle influence the likelihood of a batted ball resulting in a home run in Major League Baseball. Additionally, I looked at what the optimal thresholds are for maximizing home run probability. I used Statcast data from the 2023 and 2024 seasons to complete my project.
