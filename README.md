# Final-Project
This repository will store code and data files for the SAL 603 final project.

For my final project I looked at how exit velocity and launch angle influence the likelihood of a batted ball resulting in a home run in Major League Baseball. Additionally, I looked at what the optimal thresholds are for maximizing home run probability. I used Statcast data from the 2023 and 2024 seasons to complete my project. 

Research Questions: How do exit velocity and launch angle influence the likelihood of a batted ball resulting in a home run in Major League Baseball? What are the optimal exit velocity and launch angle thresholds for maximizing home run probability? How do different types of batted balls (e.g., line drives, fly balls, ground balls) vary in their home run potential based on exit velocity and launch angle?
